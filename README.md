# api-hack-capstone
API hack capstone roject for Thinkful, in which I build, design, and implement a web app that integrates with one or more 3rd party API(s). 
Intended as a capstone project to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript thus far. 
## Preojct Concept - Camping Search App
I'm building a web app that integrates with recreation.gov's Recreation Information Database (RIDB) API as well as OpenWeather API to provide users a variety of camping options with recommended activities, tailored to the climate/weather if they provide dates/dates within 14 days, respectively.
## Stack
I'm using JavaScript (and jQuery) with HTML and CSS
